# Windows Interactive (file) Modifier (WIM)

WIM is a [Vim](https://www.vim.org) clone but simple... yup... that's it

BTW I am writing this in WIM, yup

Keys(you can find this by typing help in the command prompt(in WIM)):
```
j - move cursor up
k - move cursor down
h - move cursor left
l - move cursor right
H - move cursor to the top of the file
E - move cursor to the end of the file
o - move cursor to the start of the line
e - move cursor to the end of the line
y - copy line
d - paste line
p - paste
t - remove everything after the cursor
r - remove everything before the cursor
^key - use these keybinds in insert mode
i - insert
a - append
ESC - normal
> - open command prompt, only in normal mode
```
